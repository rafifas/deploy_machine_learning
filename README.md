# deploy_machine_learning


machine-learning-flask-example
This project demonstrates how to train and deploy a simple model. I use a model that can predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset from https://github.com/karanmurthy7/machine-learning-flask-example. This project is composed of 5 python files: dataset, model, server, request and flask_app.

# model
diabetes-classification-model.py trains and saves the model to the disk.

# server
server.py contains all the requiered for flask and to manage APIs.

# request
request.py contains the python code to process POST request to server.

# Flask_app
flask_app.py contains the python code as modified server in pythonanywhere.com

# deploy model in pythonanywhere.com
I deployed machine learning model about diabetes prediction into pythonanywhere.com.
